# Self-Hosting
> The following items are required: [**Discord Bot Account**](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token), [**Docker-CE**](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community), and at least [**MariaDB 10.1**](https://mariadb.org/)

> This section assumes that the user has basic knowledge of workflow in his/her machine (e.g: how to run a command shell). If not then ask everyone's bestfriend, Google, first.

> **$** denotes it should be executed at a command shell.

## Build from Source

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/gazmull/ramiel-bot.git ramiel && cd ramiel`
2. Create an `auth.js` file and obtain the template from [**auth.example.js**](https://github.com/gazmull/ramiel-bot/blob/master/auth.example.js).
3. [**Set up MariaDB**](#setting-up-mariadb)
4. Create an `application.yml` file and obtain the template from [**application.example.yml**](https://github.com/gazmull/ramiel-bot/blob/master/application.example.yml).
5. Optional: edit `docker-compose.yml` according to preferences, although it is already properly configured.
   - **!** - To disable automatic updates from [**gazmull/ramiel-bot**](http://dockerhub.com/r/gazmull/ramiel-bot), make sure to put the watchtower service in comments.
6. `$ docker-compose up -d`

## Pre-built
> This repository has a pre-built Docker image over here: [**gazmull/ramiel-bot**](http://dockerhub.com/r/gazmull/ramiel-bot)

1. Create a folder named `ramiel` and then do the following in it:
2. Create an `auth.js` file and obtain the template from [**auth.example.js**](https://github.com/gazmull/ramiel-bot/blob/master/auth.example.js).
3. [**Set up MariaDB**](#setting-up-mariadb)
4. Create an `application.yml` file and obtain the template from [**application.example.yml**](https://github.com/gazmull/ramiel-bot/blob/master/application.example.yml).
5. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and obtain the template from [**docker-compose (prebuilt)**](https://gist.github.com/gazmull/1d13c735c86de2598c701968afbc6bcd).
   - Optional: edit `docker-compose.yml` according to preferences, although it is already properly configured.
     - **!** - To disable automatic updates from [**gazmull/ramiel-bot**](http://dockerhub.com/r/gazmull/ramiel-bot), make sure to put the watchtower service in comments.
6. `$ docker-compose up -d`

## Next Step
> This assumes that the user is in the `ramiel` folder.

Here are some commands to execute while running Ramiel:

- `$ docker-compose stop` to stop all services from `docker-compose.yml`
- `$ docker-compose logs -f` to see the logs from all services in real time.
- `$ docker ps -a` to show all containers (services).
- The following steps are for cleaning up (clean re-installing / uninstalling):
  1. `$ docker-compose down`
  2. `$ docker system purge -a`

## Setting Up MariaDB
> To shorten the cover of the guide, please ask Google again on how to install MariaDB. (`how to install MariaDB on [Operating System]` should be enough :angeryCat:)

1. Assuming that the MariaDB server is already installed by this section, open the MariaDB CLI (`$ mysql`), login as root, and then execute each lineâ€” replace any text wrapped with `[]` with the credentials from the `auth.js`:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE `ramiel` CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4' COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
CREATE USER `ramiel`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY '[password in auth.js]';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `ramiel`.* TO `ramiel`@`localhost`;
exit;
```
